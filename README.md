These are the links provided in the class and will be used all throughout the course.

1. Implementing word2vec: https://towardsdatascience.com/implementing-word2vec-in-pytorch-skip-gram-model-e6bae040d2fb

## Work Distribution
- [x] Grasp the ideas written in the 1st link. The article needs to be read by everyone and in case of difficulty, contact @rifazn
- [ ] Implement the code from the 1st link as much as possible by ourselves in a manner that maximises our understanding of the topics (by doing research in between, not just code)
